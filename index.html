        <h1> Housing Prices in San Francisco area </h1>
        <p>
            Real estate in San Francisco is more expensive than nearly anywhere else in the U.S.
            The median sale price of homes in San Francisco went up consecutive years from 2009 to 2019.
            So if you bought a home in San Francisco 10 years ago, it’s very likely you’d have profited on the deal
            by now — in fact, in several neighborhoods, you would have a good chance at doubling your money.

            The overall median home value in San Francisco rose a whopping 90% between April 2009 and April 2019,
            from $715,900 to $1.36 million, according to property rental and sales company Trulia.
        </p>

            In the following scene, map of San Francisco is displayed that shows the price for 2009 as default.
            It provides the options to user to slide through the years which will show the price for selected year
            through the tooltip and colors will modulate based on price increase. User can plot the landmarks that will
            be
            displayed on the map through the button on the left side of the page, similarly another button is present to
            display schools on the plot. User can click on the map to zoom-in the area and that will also show the pie
            chart
            indicating housing type and shows bar chart indicating pricing trend for that area with price/sqft on y-axis
            and year on x-axis. User further clicks on the same region of the map to zoom-out of the scene.
